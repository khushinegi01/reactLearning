# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


-----------Here's My Input From the First Lecture---------------12.02.2025

Why to use React ?


-> React was developed for solving the problem of synchronization that used to occur between the state (that was handled by javascript) and UI ((frontend) that is under the control of DOM).

-> React generally renders 2 dependencies :

    React Native - for mobile application 

    React Dom - for website

-> A React Project can be created in 2 ways 

    1. npx create-next-app@latest
    
    2. using bundler (like Vite or Parcel): npm create vite@latest (generally more used)
